# Change the Game

To build this site, clone this repository and run

```
jekyll serve
```

`*.md` pages in the home directory are pages (e.g., about speakers, for registration). Otherwise, this site is supposed to be a blog, so add `_posts` for them to appear on the home page.

To add a link use this

```
[Link name as it will appear as text hyperlink](full link including https)**
```

To add an embedded google FORM: 

```
<iframe src="[full link here]?embedded=true" width="600" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe>
```

To add an embedded google spreadsheet, see the agenda page for examples.

* Resize image before you load them
