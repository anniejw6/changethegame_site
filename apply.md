Thank you for your interest in the Change the Game Training -  Political and Organizing Data Training for Communities of Color. After you submit this application, a training organizer will follow up with next steps. For immediate questions, please refer to our [FAQ](http://changethegame.io/info/) or send us an email: changethegametraining@gmail.com . 

Because we are intentionally creating space for historically underrepresented communities in political data and technology, we are working hard to provide scholarships for those in need. Please apply, even if you’re unsure if you’ll be able to contribute to the cost of the training, including housing and other costs.
