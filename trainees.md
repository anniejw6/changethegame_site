### Emma Tramble (She/Her, @emmatramble or @tramusings)

My interests in voting rights and electoral outcomes have fueled my desire to help bring about good solutions for people since I was six-years old. During my 15++ year career, I have worked in the political, grassroots, non-profit and corporate arenas. My strategic work is done from a people first approach so that who people are and their needs are at the root of everything. I have done stints as a Data & Targeting Manager for Pennsylvania Voice and as a paid staffer or volunteer community organizer, data manager, and strategist on mayoral, state legislative and presidential campaigns. Currently, I’m leading a grassroots initiative that focuses on educating African American voters (& others) about Philly’s criminal justice system as it relates to our current District Attorney’s race. I'm a native Philadelphian, am always looking for ways to learn and share, and am known to be easily bribed with food. I consider speaking at a rally before presidential candidate Barack Obama took the stage to be a bright spot in my politically active life.
