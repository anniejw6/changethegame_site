**What is this Training?**
This is a training designed to empower members of traditionally underrepresented communities with the necessary skills to have conversations about redistricting and its politics, becoming a political data practitioner, and develop the ability to generate proposals from ideas using data. 
 
**What’s Different about this Training?**
We know that traditionally oppressed communities struggle to be seen and heard by their representative governments. Given the way legislation impacts the day to day lives of these communities, we are looking to lift and empower traditionally underrepresented organizations and staff. This space is intended to empower folks to move into a position of power in order to affect change in their communities from both within and outside organizations. 
This isn’t a traditional Data Training, where you learn technical skills you may never use again. We intend to establish a technical foundation and provide real world examples for when these technical skills have been useful.
While there is a heavy technical component, that is not the only thing you’ll learn.
 
**Who Should Apply?**
Anyone who has a vested interest in making sure that historically underrepresented communities are empowered and a desire to work in political data, tech, and analysis.
While there will be a heavy focus on the technical components necessary to run successful campaigns, that does not mean you need to know what a cell in Excel is. Or understand the previous sentence. (I like this very much.)
The ideal applicant will be a member of a traditionally underrepresented community committed to attacking the systemic problems of representative democracy in an intentional, strategic and effective way.
We are committed to intersectional solutions and we ask attendees to come with those same intentions.
